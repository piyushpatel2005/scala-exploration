# Scala Introduction

Scala is a general-purpose programming language that is designed to express common programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe way. It smoothly integrates features of object-oriented and functional languages allowing developers greater flexibility in their coding styles. Scala is also fully interoperable with Java, providing access to the vast ecosystem of Java libraries and frameworks.

## Little Bit of History

Scala was developed by Martin Odersky in 2003. The name Scala stands for "scalable language". The language was designed to address some of the criticisms of Java, while maintaining compatibility with Java code. The design of Scala was inspired by many programming languages including Java, Haskell, Scheme and few more. Scala has been under development for quite long time and usually has been the first to introduce new features that later get adopted by other JVM languages.

## Is Scala a Functional or Object-Oriented?

Scala is a hybrid language that combines object-oriented and functional programming. It is designed to be concise, expressive, and type-safe. Scala provides a rich set of features that make it easy to write functional code. It supports higher-order functions, pattern matching, and immutable data structures. Scala also provides powerful abstractions like type classes and monads that are commonly used in object oriented programming.

If you're coming from languages like C++ or Java, then you can write Scala code in an object-oriented style. It provides features like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism that are similar to Java.

On the other hand, if you're coming from languages like Javascript, Haskell, then you can easily transition to Scala's functional programming style. Scala provides features like higher-order functions, pattern matching, and immutable data structures that are commonly used in functional programming. Also functions are first class citizens in Scala so you can pass functions as arguments to other functions as well as return a function from another function as a return value.

## Why Scala?

Scala is a powerful language that offers many benefits to developers. Some of the key benefits of Scala include following.

- **Conciseness**: Scala allows developers to express complex ideas in a concise way. This can lead to more readable and maintainable code with less possibility of bugs.
- **Type Safety**: Scala is a statically typed language that provides type safety at compile time. This can help catch many errors at compile time, reducing the number of unexpected runtime errors.
- **Interoperability**: Scala is fully interoperable with Java. This means that Scala code can call Java code and vice versa. This allows developers to leverage the vast ecosystem of Java libraries and frameworks. This also allows easier trasition for Java developers to move to Scala.
- **Functional Programming**: Scala provides powerful features for functional programming. It supports higher-order functions, pattern matching, and immutable data structures. This can be very useful in distributed and concurrent programming.
- **Scalability**: Scala  can be used to write small scripts as well as large applications.
- **Performance**: Scala is a compiled language that runs on the JVM. This means that Scala code can be optimized by the JVM and can achieve very good performance.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Scala supports lazy evaluation which can be very useful in complex computations.
- **Type Inference**: Scala has a powerful type inference system that can infer types of variables and expressions. This can reduce the amount of boilerplate code that needs to be written in languages like Java.

### Who is Using Scala?

Many large enterprise organizations are adopting Scala for its scalability, performance and expressiveness. Some of the companies using Scala include Disney, Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare, Netflix, etc. There are many open source projects that are written in Scala including Apache Spark, Akka, Play Framework which have gained a lot of popularity in recent years. Frameworks like Spark are the de-facto standard for big data processing.
